As Contribution of boiler to our day to day energy consumption is significant e.g. boiler amounts to 41% of total electricity[].
avoilding unplanned shutdowns and reducing accidents involving loss of human life and equipment will impact this contribution
to much extent. Blanket solution to above problems is to provide good control of boiler plant which involves parameters such as 
ISAE,IAE etc (list down). We can find various controllers applied in different strategies to achieve this objective (list down history of contoller. While, 
we are focusing on tracking of setpoint, we should never lose sight of its economically feasibility. Purely tracking do not 
always ensures profit which any production industries demands. It can always be seen that if production is not economic feasible
then production needs to be shutdown even if we have best setpoint controller. In this position, we need a controller which 
can not only track setpoint well but also ensures return on investment.

It has been well established through research and implementation that family of model based predictive controller are outstanding
in terms of performance based on setpoint tracking and constraint handling as compare to traditional controllers. MPC based
controllers in essence computes optimized values of inputs to system such that it minimize or maximize the objective function.
Using economic parameters as objective function of MPC started exploring the capability of predictive control family in terms of 
economic performance. Moreover, we can find satisfying performance in terms of setpoint tracking as well as economic performance.
Question arises whether economic MPC perform better than MPC whose sole objective is to track setpoint. If yes, what are 
performance parameters are evaluated. If no, then at what extent we are able to accept economic MPC etc.

 

In this paper, we have tried to answer some of the questions, by comparing economic MPC, NMPC and LMPC
