As Contribution of boiler to our day to day energy consumption is significant e.g. boiler amounts to 41% of total electricity[1],
avoilding unplanned shutdowns and reducing accidents, involving loss of human life and equipment will impact this contribution
to much extent. Blanket solution to above problems is to provide good control of boiler plant whose performance measures can be use as 
integral absolute error (IAE) and Integral squared error etc (see [2] for more info ). We can find various controllers applied in different 
strategies to achieve this objective as such there are basically five fundamental control strategies; feedback control, feedforward plus feedback control, cascade control, ratio control and feedforward control [3] which can be applied on boiler system. While, 
we are focusing on tracking of setpoint, we should never lose sight of its economically feasibility. Purely tracking do not 
always ensures profit which any production industries demands. It can always be seen that if production is not economic feasible
then production needs to be shutdown even if we have best setpoint tracking controller. In this situation, we need a controller which 
can not only track setpoint well but also ensures return on investment[16].

It has been well established through research and implementation that family of model based predictive controller are outstanding
in terms of performance based on setpoint tracking and constraint handling as compare to traditional controllers[4] [5] [6] [7] [14][15]. MPC based controllers in essence computes optimized values of inputs to system whose model is available such that it minimize or maximize the objective function.
Using economic parameters to maximize or minimize as objective function of MPC started unearthing the capability of predictive control family in terms of economic performance, for implications of this EMPC (Economic Model predictive control) see [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13]. Question of stability can seen answered in literature [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] where in this paper we investigate on comparison of traditional Nonlinear MPC, Linear MPC and Economic MPC in terms of IAE, power consumption (economic factor) and objective function values [22].

We have used Drum boiler pilot plant, COEP [23] mathematical model as our system and implemented Non linear MPC (NLMPC), Linear MPC (LMPC) and Economic MPC (EMPC) in MATLAB. Simulation results has been compared on the basis of above listed parameters.

Modelling of drum boiler system is detailed in section 2, section 3 covers different MPC techniques and implementation is covered in section 4. Comparative results of state variables, input variables and objective function is shown is section 5. Conclusion based on results as to which controller perform well in terms of above mentioned parameters is discussed in detail, this covers section 6.
